# Subway and Bike-Share Ridership During COVID-19
Subway and bike-share ridership plummeted during the COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020 enacted to stop the spread of the virus. Since then, and particularly since the wide distribution of vaccines in 2021, New York City has largely reopened and activity has picked up in the city. How has Citi Bike ridership changed throughout the pandemic and how does it compare to subway ridership? Is it possible that New Yorkers are trading the subway for bikes? In this analysis I use MTA and Citi Bike data to produce a time-series of daily aggregations of subway rides and bike-share rides in NYC. I show that, while subway ridership remains well below pre-pandemic levels, bike-share ridership has indeed recovered from its Spring 2020 lows and has even surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
